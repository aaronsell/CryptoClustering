# CryptoClustering

## Overview

This project aims to explore the impact of 24-hour and 7-day price changes on cryptocurrencies using unsupervised learning techniques. The goal is to identify patterns or clusters in the data that can help predict whether a cryptocurrency’s price is likely to be influenced by short-term or weekly fluctuations.

## Objectives

	•	Data Collection: Gather historical cryptocurrency price data, focusing on 24-hour and 7-day price changes.
	•	Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
	•	Unsupervised Learning: Apply unsupervised learning algorithms (such as K-Means clustering) to identify patterns in the data.
	•	Analysis: Analyze the clusters to determine if there are any significant relationships between short-term and weekly price changes.
	•	Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate the findings.
